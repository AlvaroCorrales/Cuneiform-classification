# Cuneiform-classification

This repository contains the code that I used to solve the task for the Kaggle dataset [Cuneiform Language Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/wilstrup/cuneiform-language-identification/code). The data can be found in the dataset website. This code also refers to the Medium article *Assyrian or Babylonian? Language Identification in Cuneiform Texts* (to be published soon).
